# Multicopter Circle Mode Skeleton 

Develop your circle flight mode here. Think about which Flight Mode API setpoint type you want to use for this task.

## Expected Behavior

This flight mode should command the vehicle to fly a circular pattern with radius R=5m while facing the circle center.

## Build

This app can be built with auterion-cli. E.g. for simulation, run

```
auterion-cli app build --simulation
```
